I have been working on a Laravel Livewire e-commerce project to enhance my server-side development skills. The project incorporates dynamic UI components using Livewire and includes essential e-commerce functionalities such as product listings, categories, shopping carts, and checkouts.

In this project, I have set up routes and controllers to manage various aspects of the e-commerce platform. I can add, edit, and delete products, organize them into categories, handle user interactions seamlessly and authentication. The Livewire components allow for real-time updates without page reloads, providing a smooth user experience.

By working on this e-commerce application, I aim to deepen my understanding of Laravel, Livewire, and server-side development in general.
